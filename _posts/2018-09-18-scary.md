title: SCARY Graphs (Part 2 of 2)
---

In the previous blog post, we explored two Python graphical libraries: Matplotlib and Seaborn. We used these libraries to help create insightful yet simple graphs. Ultimately, some of the analysis you are visualizing is going to be seen by an audience. It is imperative that the audience understands what you are showing to them, and walks away from the presentation with newfound knowledge. We are going to discuss how to make graphs for presentations.

## Making SCARY Graphs

Creating visual analysis when you are data mining is one thing, but having a group of people consume it is another. There are definitely good ways and bad ways to present data. Even graphs and charts that are technically correct can be misunderstood if they are not created with the audience in mind. In order to get people to buy what you’re selling them, you need to create **SCARY** graphs. **SCARY** stands for:

* **Simple** Aesthetic
* **Clear** Labels
* **Authentic** Data
* **Replicable** Code
* **Yeasable** Audience

Let’s go through all of these, shall we?

### Simple Aesthetic

Simple Aesthetic means the graph being presented to the audience is easy on the eyes, and they can identify the patterns as self-evident. First off, the graph needs to be visually appealing. I call this the Billboard Test: it should not take any more cognitive effort to extract the information from the graph than what it would take to achieve the same task if you were reading a billboard on the highway. If you have to squint your eyes on the first read of your own graph, then it’s probably too difficult for the eyes of the audience. If you can pass the billboard test, then the graph is easy on the eyes.

Bars should be thick with solid colors. Lines should be fat with dots where the X-Axis and Y-Axis intersects. Scatter plots should have distinct relationships (or non-relationships) between the dots. Pies should be used sparingly, but to illustrate business/research related discovery or impact. If the audience can identify clean relationships from the graphs being presented, then the patterns are self-evident.

### Clear Labels

Clear Labels means that Titles, X-Axis labels, Y-Axis labels, legends and data points are easily read and are not misinterpreted. This goes hand in hand with **Simple Aesthetic**. The labels need to complement the visual. The title needs to be bold and the largest font for the graph. X-Axis and Y-Axis labels also need be bold and spell out what it means. X-Axis and Y-Axis ticks (the frequency of data marks on the Axis) need to be logical and consistent. The ticks should not be too close or too far apart based on the data that’s being plotted. Legends should be placed in the proper place (if there needs to be one). Lastly, data points for Bars, Lines and Pies should have data points labeled if it helps the viewer understand the graph.

### Authentic Data

Authentic Data means the data being shown is not false or incorrect data in the back-end and misrepresented in the front-end. For the first part of this definition, business rules are extremely important to follow when it comes to plotting. Each domain (Finance, Research, Health Care, Education, etc) has their own set of business rules for each facet of their domain. These rules are the guidelines of data quality and agreement on business processes day-in and day-out.  If business rules are not being applied correctly, the audience will misinterpret what is being presented to them. Moving past business rules, although this is obvious, check your mathematical work before it gets shown to an audience. Sometimes when you are calculating a SQL statement like:

{% highlight sql %}
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN SBAC_ELA_PL > 2 THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END), 4) * 100 AS 'ELA Percent Proficient'
{% endhighlight %}

That it doesn’t calculate correctly. It might be worth your while to do some calculations by hand to check if your SQL, Python or R code is calculating your numbers correctly. This is monotonous to do, but it could save your reputation if you catch an error before you make the finalization to your analysis.

The second part of the definition (…misrepresented in the front-end) refers to the actual visual and what the data means. If you are comparing lines or bars or even two graphs, they should be measured on the exact same scale. X-Axis ticks, Y-Axis ticks and the size of the graphs should be the same. The reality of the data should not change depending on how you adjust the formatting of the graphs. That’s a big no-no. The data being presented to the audience should speak for itself and should not require pulling a fast one to receive a positive reaction.

### Replicable Code

Replicable Code means that the graph can be reproduced after the fact. This is less of a presentation concern and more of an automation or adjusting analysis in the future. If you produce code in a way that you have a base template for the future, the amount of time it takes to produce another set of graphs is significantly reduced. You can spend more time doing tougher or greater quantity of analysis rather than spending time fine-tuning the visual itself. Also, audience members may suggest ideas that would be useful for them to know in the next iteration of analysis. Having code that’s already in place that needs only slightly adjustments to get their answer means the turn-around is much quicker, and you look good while doing it.

### Yeasble Audience

Lastly, Yeasble Audience means the audience agrees about the interpretation of your graphs when it is being presented. This is where all of the previous letters in **SCARY** graphs come together. If the audience has multiple questions asking you to restate data points or to go over the graph again, you may have to work on the visual itself or your delivery. If the audience is completely silent, you may extend a hand and have them interact with you so they are involved in the presentation. A silent audience might mean they don’t understand you at all, or you are so good in your delivery they don’t have any questions to ask. Keep an eye on the reactions of individuals in the audience because they will tell you non-verbally what they are thinking.

To get a Yeasable Audience, you want everybody to be on the same page when you present your findings. Individuals who are skeptical of your analysis or have questions is to be expected (and preferable; it means they care). As long as the audience is not protesting you, then you have achieved the **Y** in **SCARY**.

## Summary

Analysis is hard work. Getting an audience to understand your analysis is even harder. Communicating effectively is how data-driven decisions are made in the workplace. With these tools in your toolkit, you now have what it takes to make some **SCARY** graphs!

I may revisit this article in the future.
